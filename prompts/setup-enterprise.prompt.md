# /setup-enterprise

Load the `setup-enterprise-stack` skill and run its three-mode flow (emit / consent-install / audit) against the user's Copilot CLI configuration.

Steps:

1. Load skill: [setup-enterprise-stack](../skills/setup-enterprise-stack/SKILL.md).
2. Ask the user which mode they want: **emit only** (safe default), **consent-gated auto-install**, or **audit only**. If the user does not answer, default to emit.
3. In **emit only** mode, do not create or update todos, tasks, plan items, or
   any other host planning state. Do not modify files, settings, plugins, or
   marketplace registrations. Return the block and guidance directly.
4. Check prerequisites per the skill's Prerequisites section. Warn about missing subscriptions / licenses but do not refuse to emit.
5. Verify the Copilot CLI version (`copilot --version` >= 1.0.75). If missing or too old, direct the user to <https://github.com/github/copilot-cli> and stop.
6. Execute the chosen mode.
7. Report what changed (or, in emit mode, what the user must paste).

Fires only when the user explicitly asks — `/setup-enterprise` is not auto-invoked. The skill body carries the JSON block, the prerequisite table, and the consent-gate rules.
