description: "Orchestrates expert visual storytelling over Flint: frame the claim, inspect data, explore familiar and expressive treatments over one semantic truth layer, select or author a theme, render, compare, iterate, and verify. Use for open-ended chart and data-story requests; preserves fast paths for diagnostic charts, fully formed specs, and explicit treatments."

# /alex-act-one render-chart

Follow these steps in order. Skip any step that the user's request has already answered.

For each skill below, use a project override at
`.github/skills/local/<name>/SKILL.md` when one exists. Otherwise use the host's
skill tool to load the named bundled skill. If that tool cannot expose it, read
the explicit bundled link relative to this prompt in the installed ONE package,
not relative to the adopter's working directory. An adopter does not need a
local `skills/` tree. Confirm both the tool lookup and the actual installed
file before reporting a missing capability or recommending installation.

1. **Load [chart-big-idea](../skills/chart-big-idea/SKILL.md)** and produce a Chart Brief using the resolution rule above. Follow its numbered steps: **Step 0** (read the surrounding docs / prose / ticket / section heading for an existing Big Idea before asking the user anything), Step 1 (draft or elicit the Big Idea — use the 3-question ladder one question at a time if Step 0 didn't surface it), Steps 2–5 (story arc, audience, style stance, Brief). Classify the intent as **explanatory, exploratory, or persuasive**, and record a **theme / tone stance**. **Ask the user the TRADITIONAL vs INNOVATIVE style-stance question explicitly** unless they've already stated a preference. The output is the compact Chart Brief block that Steps 3-6 below consume as their constraint.

   Skip only if the user provided a fully-formed spec, is iterating style/color on an already-chosen chart, or is doing purely exploratory data profiling — see the skill's "When to invoke" section.

2. **Load [flint-chart](../skills/flint-chart/SKILL.md)** using the same resolution rule. If it is genuinely unavailable after checking the installed package, report the exact missing capability and stop.

3. **Understand the data.** If the user attached a file, read the first ~20 rows to see column names, types, and cardinality. If not, ask for a sample, file path, or paste. Do not chart blind — the skill's "Sanity-read the values first" rule applies.

4. **Confirm the analytical question** using the skill's §0.1 (one-sentence message). The Brief's Big Idea usually IS the one-sentence message — if not, tighten it now. Do not re-elicit if Step 1 already produced it. If the requested claim conflicts with the data, stop and surface the conflict; do not choose a chart that hides the disagreement.

5. **Pick the creative range.** Use `chart-vocabulary` and the `flint-chart` §0.2 table (question → family → chartType), constrained by the Brief. For an open-ended storytelling request, author two materially different candidates over the **same `data` and `semantic_types`**: one **familiar** treatment and one more **expressive** treatment. Change chart family, arrangement, faceting, direct labels, reference structure, or theme with intent; do not produce palette-only alternatives. If the user chose a treatment explicitly, supplied a fully formed spec, or requested a diagnostic chart, take the fast path and author only that treatment.

6. **Author the candidate `ChartAssemblyInput` values** per the skill's Step 1 (chartType), Step 2 (encodings), Step 3 (semantic types). Reference data columns by name. Reuse the semantic truth layer across candidates. For a standalone Vega-Lite chart, set `chart_spec.title` from the Brief's Big Idea and set `chart_spec.subtitle` to the measure, population, period, and units. Omit them only when a surrounding caption already supplies that reading; for ECharts or Chart.js, retain the authored text and make it visible in the surrounding artifact after inspecting the compiled result. Select a preset theme with `list_themes`, or load `flint-theme` when the user needs a custom visual system.

7. **Render and compare.** For a Vega-Lite candidate, default to `create_chart_view` (interactive SVG panel with customization sidebar) when the host supports MCP App UI. For ECharts or Chart.js, use `render_chart` or `compile_chart`: both Vega-Lite and ECharts can render PNG/SVG, while Chart.js renders PNG only. ThemeSpec realizes only in Vega-Lite. Render both serious candidates when feasible, then compare first focal point, reading order, message hierarchy, context, accessibility, and study cost against the Brief. Use `validate_chart` first if you're unsure a spec is well-formed. Use `compile_chart` when the user wants backend-native JSON.

8. **Verify and iterate — look at what you rendered.** Load [render-verify](../skills/render-verify/SKILL.md) using the same resolution rule. Use the host's built-in browser tools if it has them and they can open the artifact; otherwise the optional `alex-playwright` MCP server. Read console errors _before_ judging the picture, then walk the skill's chart and storytelling checks. Repair visible defects and re-render the smallest responsible layer. Check that the selected picture carries the Brief's Big Idea without relying on surrounding prose to explain what the visual failed to show.

   **Mandatory** after any post-Flint Vega-Lite edit and before committing generated HTML/SVG/PNG. If you have no way to look at the result, say so in Step 9 rather than implying it was checked.

9. **Report** what you chose and why, using the Brief as the spine:
   - The Brief's Big Idea + story arc + style stance
   - Which chart family + chartType you picked
   - Which alternates from the Brief and from §0.2 you considered
   - The strongest rejected alternative and the trade-off that made it lose
   - Any anti-patterns you avoided (per §0.3 or per `chart-big-idea` anti-patterns)
   - **Whether you verified the render, and how** — or that you could not

If the `flint` MCP server isn't registered, point the user at the plugin README's Install section and stop — do not attempt to render.

## Anti-patterns for this prompt

- **Skipping Step 1 (Chart Brief).** Rendering before framing is the top failure mode. The Brief is 10 lines; the wrong chart costs a re-render plus a user correction.
- **Not asking the TRADITIONAL vs INNOVATIVE question.** Both are valid; the user is entitled to the choice. Silent defaults produce mismatches when the audience is glance-time and you picked innovative because it was more interesting to render.
- **Guessing at data shape.** Read the actual rows. Column names lie; sample values don't.
- **Rendering before framing.** If you can't write the one-sentence message from §0.1 (or the Brief's Big Idea), you don't know what chart to pick yet.
- **Skipping §0.4 (Flint coverage).** If the Brief or §0.2 recommends a chart Flint can't build (Waffle, Chord, Beeswarm, SPC, AI-powered), substitute per §0.4 before authoring the spec — otherwise the render will fail.
- **Overloading a single chart.** More than ~5 series on a line, more than ~5 slices on a pie, more than ~4 series on grouped bars → propose Small Multiples (`row`/`column` facet) or split into multiple charts.
- **Claiming a render is correct without opening it.** "The tool returned success" means bytes were written, not that the picture is true. Step 8 exists because `validate_chart` passing and the chart being right are different facts.
- **Palette-only creativity.** A new color set is not a materially different treatment. Change the rhetorical or perceptual strategy.
- **Changing semantics to dramatize an alternative.** Candidate treatments share data and semantic types unless a named upstream transformation changes the analytical question.

## Would Revise If

Revise this prompt by 2026-10-25 (90 days) or sooner if:

- Users consistently skip Step 1 or find the Chart Brief too heavy (indicates `chart-big-idea` needs its "tighten to 3 fields" fallback triggered).
- Users consistently skip Steps 2-5 (indicating the numbered flow is too heavy for the common case).
- Users consistently skip Step 8 (indicating verification belongs inside the render step rather than as its own stage).
- `create_chart_view` becomes unavailable in the majority of hosts (revise the default in step 7).
- `create_chart_view`'s interactive panel turns out to make Step 8 redundant for non-edited charts — then narrow Step 8 to post-Flint edits and committed artifacts only.
- The `flint-chart` skill's §0 section is restructured such that these step references (§0.1, §0.2, §0.4, §0.5) go stale.
