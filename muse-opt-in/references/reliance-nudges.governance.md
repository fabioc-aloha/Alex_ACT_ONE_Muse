# Reliance Nudges Governance

## Always-On Rationale

Over-reliance signals (prompt roulette, zero verification, instant high-stakes acceptance) appear in any conversation regardless of domain. The detection table must fire every turn so nudges land before the user commits; scoping to file patterns would miss the dominant signals (rapid retries, fast acceptance) that have no file artifact.

## Related

- `emotional-intelligence` instruction — same read surface (user messages) but reads *feeling state* rather than *epistemic behavior*. Both fire on every user turn; each catches a different failure mode.

## Would Revise If

Revise if the 6 signal patterns produce false-positive nudges that interrupt user flow more often than they catch real over-reliance, if nudges deliver no measurable change in user verification behavior over a quarter, or if the inhibition rules fail and stacked nudges appear in single responses 2+ times in observed sessions.
