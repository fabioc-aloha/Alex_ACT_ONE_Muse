# Proactive Awareness

Whether to surface what you notice is decided by the Inhibition Rules in the
`reliance-nudges` instruction, which holds the silence and frustration floors.
Use this skill once that decision is made, to apply PA1, PA2, or PA4.

## Cross-Session Context Recovery (PA1)

At the start of every relevant conversation:

1. **Check repo-root `HANDOFF.md`** — the canonical project handoff. If present,
   read current state, blockers, next action, and verification; tolerate older
   section names without assuming they contain the full backlog.
2. **Check the authoritative task list** linked from handoff or `AGENTS.md`.
   Otherwise read root `TODO.md` if present. Use relevant pending work to inform
   recovery, not to force old tasks onto a new request. If handoff is missing,
   tasks can still establish unfinished work; note the missing restart context.
3. **Check session memory** — Read `/memories/session/` as a secondary signal. Session memory is by-design ephemeral and clears at conversation end; any handoff content here is a lower-tier signal than `HANDOFF.md`. Scan titles and status fields if present.
4. **Check dream reports (if available)** — If `.github/quality/dream-report.json` exists, note the last dream date and any issues. Skip silently if absent — not every project ships a dream pipeline.
5. **Summarize briefly** — If relevant prior context exists in handoff, the task
   list, or session memory, offer a one-line recovery summary subject to the
   inhibition rules. These checks are read-only; do not rewrite continuity
   records or create episodic/native memory as part of recovery.

### When to Surface Context

| Signal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `HANDOFF.md` present with recent content | Mention proactively |
| Authoritative task list has work relevant to this request | Use it to inform recovery; do not repeat the whole backlog |
| Session memory file with `Status: Active` | Mention proactively (secondary signal) |
| Session memory file with `Status: Concluded` | Skip — already wrapped up |
| No handoff, authoritative task list, or session memory | Start fresh, no mention |
| Dream report shows issues (if dream pipeline present) | Mention if relevant to current request |

### When NOT to Surface

- User's first message is clearly a new topic — don't force old context
- User explicitly starts with "new topic" or unrelated request
- Session memory is stale (>7 days old)

## Uncommitted Work Detection (PA2)

When starting a session or after completing a task that touched files:

1. **Check git status** — Look for staged but uncommitted changes, or modified tracked files.
2. **Privacy**: Surface file *count* only, not file names or paths, in nudges.
3. **Threshold**: Only alert if uncommitted changes are >24 hours old (based on file modification time).
4. **Nudge format**: *"You have N uncommitted changes from [timeframe]. Want to review and commit?"*

### Detection Rules

| Condition | Priority | Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staged changes >4 days | High | "N files staged but uncommitted for N days" |
| Staged changes >24h | Medium | "N uncommitted staged changes" |
| Modified tracked files >24h (not staged) | Low | Mention only if user asks about project status |

## Focus Routing (PA4)

Read `.github/config/goals.json` for the user's active focus (heir-authored; absent on fresh installs by design):

1. If an active goal exists, mention it at session start: *"Current focus: [goal title]"*
2. When the user's request is ambiguous, route toward the active goal.
3. Don't force routing — if the user clearly wants something else, follow their lead.

## Boundaries

- Do not override the resident silence or frustration inhibition floors.
- Do not expose worktree filenames or paths in an uncommitted-work nudge.
- Do not treat ephemeral session memory as the durable cross-session handoff.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Surfacing stale continuity during a new topic | Let the resident gate suppress it. |
| Naming changed files in a nudge | Report only a count and timeframe. |
| Forcing the active goal onto a clear user request | Follow the explicit request. |

## Would Revise If

Revisit by **2026-11-18** if the detailed procedure fails to load after the
resident route, a continuity nudge interrupts flow despite the inhibitory gate,
or a handoff response uses session memory instead of `HANDOFF.md`.
