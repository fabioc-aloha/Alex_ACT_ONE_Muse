# Bootstrap Core

Apply the canonical, user-scope modules from this package. The canonical
sources live in this edition's `muse-opt-in/` directory.

> **Muse edition:** there is no always-on instruction mechanism and no plugin
> loader in Muse. Activation is a deliberate user decision, not a scripted
> install — the user copies or adapts a module into their own assistant
> configuration. The bundled scripts (`host-readiness.cjs`, `bootstrap-core.cjs`)
> still target Copilot host paths (`~/.copilot/instructions`, `.github/instructions`)
> and are preserved for reference; they do not describe Muse activation. The
> receipts mechanism below records what the scripts wrote, so any host can be
> reconciled against the canonical sources.

Skill files in the `skills/` folder and `.prompt.md` prompts in the `prompts/` folder do not need installation; they are loaded through the skill tool from the installed plugin path.

## Modules

This skill activates user-scope `.instructions.md` modules from the canonical
`muse-opt-in/` sources. Each module is individually opt-in: review its
description in `muse-opt-in/README.md` and adopt only what fits.

## Preview First

Preview is the decision point — consent follows the preview, not the other way
around.

```text
node <this-skill>/scripts/host-readiness.cjs --host <host>
```

```text
node <this-skill>/scripts/bootstrap-core.cjs --target-instructions <dir> --workspace-instructions <dir> [--apply]
```

`--host` picks the report's target host. Both commands support `--json`. See the
scripts' usage text for the full flag list.

In the Muse edition the scripts resolve the canonical `muse-opt-in/` sources
but still default to Copilot host target paths; pass `--target-instructions`
explicitly for any other destination. Run the preview against the resolved
target before any `--apply`.

## Host Readiness

Start with a host-specific readiness report when the activation steps are
unclear:

```text
node <this-skill>/scripts/host-readiness.cjs --host scout
node <this-skill>/scripts/host-readiness.cjs --host scout --json
```

Supported hosts are `copilot-cli`, `vscode`, `github-copilot-app`, and `scout`.
The report runs the bootstrap preview for the selected target and names what
still belongs to that host. It writes no instructions or MCP registry entries,
does not enable UI settings, and cannot prove a host has restarted or observed
the activation.

For Scout, the report also previews its separate MCP registration and names the
required **Load Copilot CLI skills** setting and full restart. Review the
existing bootstrap and registrar previews, then run each `--apply` command
separately after consent.

## Apply After Consent

Show the resolved target, its source, exact file actions, user scope, receipt
action, overlap report, and installed plugin version. Ask:

> Activate these modules for every workspace on this machine?

Quote the actual count from the preview's `expectedFiles` rather than a number
remembered from last time.

After an explicit yes, rerun the same command with `--apply`. The script writes
only changed files, writes `.alex-act-one-bootstrap.json` atomically when its
content needs creation or refresh, and verifies every destination and the
receipt against canonical sources. A no-op apply preserves receipt bytes.

The receipt owns only the files this plugin installed. It never claims a
greeting instruction from another plugin or any user-authored file. A valid
legacy mixed receipt is evidence for preserving matching bytes, not authority to
rewrite or delete another plugin's state.

Receipts written through version 0.3.0 record `alex-act-core` as
`bootstrappedBy` and as each entry's `owner`, with a former source path. A
subsequent `--apply` validates their hashes and migration shape, then refreshes
them to `alex-act-one` ownership and the canonical `muse-opt-in/` source path
without rewriting unchanged instruction files. Preview reports the legacy
receipt as a refresh; `--remove` continues to recognize it as owned until the
migration runs.

## Repair And Idempotency

A current bootstrap requires:

1. Canonical source instructions matching the manifest inventory exactly.
2. A schema-v2 receipt carrying the installed plugin version.
3. One disjoint receipt entry per instruction.
4. Source, destination, and receipt SHA-256 parity.

Equal versions do not hide byte drift. A second preview after apply must report
only preserve actions and a preserved receipt.

## Remove Instructions

Preview removal with `--remove`. Apply only after explicit removal consent by
adding `--apply`. The script removes only receipt-owned destinations whose
current hashes still match the receipt. Modified or unowned files are preserved
and reported. Receipt entries must match the manifest-backed ownership set
exactly; unsafe, duplicate, foreign, or malformed entries fail closed before
path resolution. Clean removal verifies every deletion and removes the
receipt. Modified owned bytes and their receipt remain as recovery evidence.
Files owned by another plugin's receipt are never removed.

## Boundaries

- Self-activation is not general plugin lifecycle management.
- Do not install, update, enable, disable, or uninstall plugins here.
- Do not copy plugin directories, caches, settings, or unowned instructions.
- Do not write unowned instruction or external continuity state.
- Do not fetch instruction bodies from the network.
- Do not silently apply during install or session start.
- Do not delete by filename glob; receipt and hash ownership are required.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Require another plugin before this one can activate | Run this plugin's own bootstrap command |
| Copy instructions without preview | Show exact actions and machine-wide scope first |
| Treat a skill as equivalent to always-applied policy | Activate the canonical instruction files |
| Delete every `alex-act-*` file | Remove only valid receipt entries with matching hashes |
| Claim a greeting instruction this plugin did not install | Keep separate receipts per owning plugin |
| Assume one activation covers every host | Resolve the target per host and activate each explicitly |

## Would Revise If

Revise by **2026-12-07** if this plugin alone cannot activate every declared
source, a preview mutates state, a receipt claims a file it does not own, source
resolution fails in a delivered plugin, or removal deletes modified bytes.
