# render-verify: look at what you rendered

## Why this skill exists

A visual artifact can be **technically valid and still tell the wrong story**. A
chart with a collapsed axis, a merged color scale, or an empty data binding
renders cleanly. So does a report whose images 404, whose text is clipped, or
whose stylesheet never loaded. No validator catches any of it. `validate_chart`
proves a spec is well-formed, not that the picture is true. Only looking does.

This is the plugin's characteristic bug shape — see _Known failure modes_ in the
repo docs. Every other silent failure here is a config path; this one is a
picture.

**The rule:** if you rendered it, opened it, or edited it, look at it before you
say it is done.

**Scope.** The method below — open, read the console first, walk a catalog, check
the claim — is general. It applies to charts, generated HTML reports, SVG
figures, dashboards, diagrams, and printable output. Charts are the
deepest-worked case because this plugin produces them, and their catalog is the
longest; a shorter general catalog follows it.

## When to invoke

**Mandatory:**

- After **any post-Flint Vega-Lite edit.** The `flint-chart` skill forbids
  sending an edited spec back to `render_chart`, so the MCP server's own
  validation no longer protects you. You are flying without instruments.
- Before **committing generated HTML, SVG, or PNG.** Inline specs fail silently.
- When the artifact is **layered, faceted, multi-series, or multi-figure.** Most
  failures below come from layer, scale, or layout interaction.

**Recommended:**

- After the first render of anything that will be shown to someone other than
  the person who asked for it.
- Whenever you changed the data binding or the page structure, not just styling.

**Skip:**

- Single-layer chart, small embedded data, spec unchanged since a render you
  already looked at.
- The user is iterating rapidly on color or title only.

## The failure catalog — charts

These render without error. Check each one explicitly — the list is the point of
the skill, not the tooling.

| Failure                            | What you see                                                   | Usual cause                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Empty binding**                  | Axes, gridlines, legend — and no marks                         | Data ref resolved to nothing. A chart with no data still looks like a chart. **Rule out a render race first** — see capability 5 in Step 1 |
| **Collapsed scale**                | Everything squashed into a fraction of the plot area           | One layer forced `zero: true` (or a quantitative axis) into a shared scale                                                                 |
| **Merged color scale**             | A mark is the wrong color for its meaning                      | Two layers' color scales resolved together. Fix with independent scale resolution, not by recoloring                                       |
| **Undefined category**             | A blank, `null`, or `undefined` row/tick on a categorical axis | Mis-encoded layer contributing to a shared categorical domain                                                                              |
| **Duplicate marks**                | Rows repeated, bars double-height                              | Missing dedup upstream — a data problem wearing a chart costume                                                                            |
| **Embedded totals**                | One bar dwarfs the rest; parts look flat                       | An aggregate level (`all`, `Total`) charted alongside its own parts                                                                        |
| **Double-scaled units**            | Percentages at 0–10000, or everything at 0.0x                  | A 0–100 rate tagged as `Percentage` and scaled again                                                                                       |
| **Overplotting**                   | A solid blob instead of a distribution                         | Too many marks, no opacity/jitter/binning                                                                                                  |
| **Right on sample, wrong on real** | Looks perfect, means nothing                                   | Verified against test rows, never against the actual dataset                                                                               |

## The failure catalog — any rendered artifact

For generated HTML, SVG, dashboards, diagrams, and printable output. These also
render without error, and a screenshot alone can look plausible.

| Failure                                  | What you see                                                          | Usual cause                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing resource**                     | A broken-image icon, a blank figure slot, an unstyled block           | A 404 on an image, stylesheet, font, or script. **The console names it** — this is why Step 2 reads errors first |
| **Unstyled content**                     | Raw serif text, no layout, everything left-aligned                    | The stylesheet never loaded, or loaded after the capture                                                         |
| **Clipped or overflowing text**          | Sentences cut mid-word, labels truncated, text escaping its container | Fixed heights, `overflow: hidden`, or a font substitution that changed metrics                                   |
| **Font substitution**                    | Right words, wrong typeface; spacing subtly off                       | A web font failed to load and a fallback took over. Silent by design                                             |
| **Layout collapse**                      | Columns stacked, panels overlapping, huge whitespace                  | The captured viewport hit a responsive breakpoint you did not intend                                             |
| **Below-the-fold content never checked** | Everything visible looks fine                                         | Only the viewport was captured. Scroll or capture full-page                                                      |
| **Stale render**                         | Your change is not there                                              | Viewing a cached copy, an old build output, or a different file than you edited                                  |
| **Placeholder survived**                 | Literal `TODO`, `Lorem ipsum`, `{{value}}`, `undefined`, `NaN`        | A template slot never filled. Search the rendered text, not just the source                                      |
| **SVG XML invalid**                      | Chart title shows, chart body missing; screenshot looks like a fragment | An SVG injected as inline HTML during a PDF build parses lenient; `<img src>` is strict and drops the document at the first parser error. Two common causes: `--` inside an XML comment (prose punctuation habit — `(kept in AFTER -- helps read data)`) and a bare `&` outside a comment. **Fix in the generator, never in the SVG** — regen clobbers manual SVG patches |
| **Prose contradicts figure**             | Numbers in the surrounding paragraph do not match the chart's data     | The dataset moved forward, the prose did not. Five surfaces drift: Big Idea sentence, caption / alt text, anchoring paragraph, numeric claims, and figure text that belongs in prose. See "Prose-coupling check" below |
| **Lazy-load blindness**                  | Coverage page reports "62 figures" but only 7 fetched                  | `<img loading="lazy">` on a proofing or coverage surface. Only images in the viewport fire the request; a screenshot or scroll-through verifies exactly the images that happened to be visible. The rest could all be 404 and no one would know. Fix: strip `loading="lazy"` on any coverage / review page |
| **Agent-browser-only pass**              | Renders correctly for you; blank or broken for the reader              | The artifact `fetch()`es a sibling file and was verified over `file://`. The agent browser permits that; a normal browser treats each `file://` document as an opaque origin and blocks it. Re-verify over `http://` — see _When `file://` is not enough_ |

## Prose-coupling check (before shipping a published figure)

The failure catalogs pin what the figure SHOWS. This check pins what the surrounding PROSE CLAIMS about the figure. Numbers drift silently between them, and the reader reads both.

Before declaring a figure done in a document / chapter / report / worked solution, sweep these five surfaces:

| Surface                                     | Check                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Big Idea sentence**                       | The chapter or section's one-line takeaway still holds against the data, and it matches the figure's own subtitle       |
| **Caption / alt text**                      | Describes what the figure now shows. Alt text IS the caption in most publication workflows                              |
| **Anchoring paragraph**                     | Introduces the figure with the correct panels in the correct order (BEFORE-left, AFTER-right for paired panels)         |
| **Numeric claims**                          | Every number the prose cites (`$4.2M`, `2.18×`, `78%`) appears in the dataset. Include category names and sort order, not just values |
| **Figure text that belongs in the chapter** | Sentence-length exposition inside the SVG is a smell — propose relocation to the chapter body                             |

### Look for the non-data lever first

When numbers drift, the fix that preserves the argument is usually a NARRATIVE lever — a threshold, a target, or a round-number goal — that lives only in prose. Moving it does not break the dataset OR the contract test.

Example: prose says "the channel needs to clear a $2.00 target" but `channel-romi.json` contains no `2.00`. Raising the target to `$2.50` corrects the wrong-figure references and leaves the beat, the Big Idea, the dataset, and the contract test all untouched. Rewriting the numbers to match the prose is more expensive and touches more surfaces.

Priority order when the prose is wrong:

1. **Number wrong in prose, right in data**: fix the prose. Do not ask.
2. **Two valid fixes, one preserves the rhetorical shape**: take that one, even if the diff is larger.
3. **Only correct fix changes what the passage argues**: stop and ask.
4. **Wording awkward but numbers right**: out of scope for this skill.

Adapted from a published decision-analysis book's figure-authoring practice.

## Step 1 — pick a verification capability

**If the artifact is ASCII, stop here and use the ASCII branch below instead.**
Steps 1 through 3 assume a rendered artifact that a browser can open. An ASCII
chart has no such artifact: the text in the code fence is both the source and
the render, so there is nothing to screenshot and no console to read.

For ASCII, substitute [`ascii-chart`](../ascii-chart/SKILL.md) Module 5, the
alignment QA loop. It covers the same ground for a character grid: validate
every line against the width constant, verify borders and padding by counting
characters rather than eyeballing them, and re-check after each fix. That is
the ASCII equivalent of opening the render and reading the errors.

Then rejoin at Step 4. Claim checking and honest reporting do not depend on a
renderer, so the Storytelling read-back, the mutation check, and Step 5 apply
unchanged. Geometry passing is not the same as the numbers being right, and on
a character grid that gap is easy to miss: a chart can validate perfectly while
displaying a value the data does not support.

This skill names the **capability**, not a product. Work down this ladder and
stop at the first rung that works. **Do not install a second MCP server for a
job the host already does.**

1. **The host's own browser capability — always try this first.** If your tool
   inventory contains anything that opens a page and returns a screenshot or a
   page snapshot _to you_, use it. This rung costs nothing and has no security
   trade-off. **What it covers depends on the host, and the difference decides
   whether rung 2 is needed at all:**

   | Host | Native browser | Opens `file://` | Rung 2 needed for local artifacts |
   | ---- | -------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | Muse | Built-in tools | **Yes**         | No — rung 1 is sufficient         |

   (Copilot edition: the multi-host table — VS Code Copilot, Microsoft Scout,
   GitHub Copilot CLI — is preserved for reference. In the Muse edition the
   only host is Muse.) Do not assume a host that _has_ a browser can open
   local files with it — probe by doing, not by asking.

2. **Deeper browser tooling — fallback, or the only path.**
   Use when rung 1 is absent, when rung 1 cannot open `file://` and the artifact
   is local, or when rung 1 lacks console-error access and the defect you are
   chasing needs a cause rather than a symptom. In the Copilot edition this rung
   was the optional `alex-playwright` MCP server (setup section preserved for
   reference below; see `docs/muse-capability-map.md`). In the Muse edition,
   substitute the host's own browser tools — a second tool call that reads
   console output, a page snapshot, or a fresh screenshot. It carries real
   costs: more tool calls, and any artifacts written land in the working
   directory.
3. **The human.** Ask the user to open the artifact and describe what they see,
   or give them a specific checklist item to confirm. This is a legitimate
   outcome, not a failure — but it must be _stated_.

**Never silently skip verification.** If you reached rung 3, or if you have
partial capability (see below), say so plainly in your report. An unverified
chart described as verified is worse than an unverified chart.

### Which capabilities you actually need

"Can open HTML" is not one capability — it is five, and hosts differ in which
they provide. Establish what you have _before_ interpreting what you see.

| #   | Capability                                                                         | Needed for                                | If missing                                                               |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Open a local `file://`**                                                         | Reaching the artifact at all              | Fall back to a `render_chart` PNG/SVG, or rung 3                         |
| 2   | **Agent-readable output** (screenshot or accessibility snapshot returned _to you_) | Steps 3–4                                 | You are on rung 3 — the human is verifying, not you                      |
| 3   | **Console-error access**                                                           | Step 2 — finding the _cause_              | You can still see symptoms; say that causes were not checked             |
| 4   | **Element-scoped or scrolled capture**                                             | Multi-figure artifacts                    | Verify one figure per page-load, or accept reduced confidence and say so |
| 5   | **Wait-for / re-capture after render**                                             | Anything JS-rendered (Vega-Lite, ECharts) | **See the false-positive warning below**                                 |

> [!WARNING]

### When `file://` is not enough

Default to opening the artifact directly. The VS Code integrated browser
[supports `http://`, `https://`, and `file://` URLs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/integrated-browser), and an
agent-opened `file://` page needs no server, no flags, and no deploy. Reach for
something heavier only when one of these holds.

| Situation                                                            | What you actually need                            | Why                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **You are in a remote workspace** (Dev Container, SSH, WSL, Codespace) | Serve over `http`                                 | `file://` URLs are **not proxied** over a remote connection; the tab shows a warning indicator instead                                                                                           |

Probe by **doing, not by asking**: attempt the action against the real artifact
and observe the result. Tool names vary between hosts; outcomes do not.

## Step 2 — open it and read the errors first

1. **Open the artifact.** For local files use the canonical absolute
   `file:///…` form.
2. **Read the console errors before looking at the picture.** This is the check
   that finds the cause rather than the symptom — a silently-failing inline
   Vega-Lite spec throws to the console while still rendering a plausible-looking
   page. With the Playwright server this is `browser_console_messages` at level
   `error`.
3. **Then screenshot it.**

Zero console errors plus a wrong-looking artifact means a spec, data, or layout
problem. Console errors plus a right-looking artifact means you are probably
looking at a stale render.

## Step 3 — check the picture against the catalogs

Walk the chart table if it is a chart, and the general table for anything that
is rendered as a page. Then, for multi-figure artifacts:

- **Scroll each figure into view and capture it separately.** A single full-page
  screenshot visually hides defects in unfocused figures.
- **Check the axes have real domains** — not `[0, 0]`, not a collapsed range,
  no `undefined` ticks.
- **Count the marks** against what the data should produce.
- **Search the rendered text for placeholders** — `TODO`, `undefined`, `NaN`,
  `{{`, `Lorem`. Search what rendered, not the source that produced it.

## Step 4 — check the claim, not just the render

Every artifact worth verifying exists to carry a claim. For charts that is the
Big Idea from the `chart-big-idea` skill; for a report or diagram it is whatever
the surrounding prose asserts. **A correct render of a wrong claim is still a
defect.**

- **Verify prose claims arithmetically against the plotted or tabulated values.**
  If the caption says "less than a fifth of the noise", compute it.
  Order-of-magnitude overstatements in captions survive every automated check
  there is.
- **Re-read the claim and ask whether the picture shows it.** If the claim is
  about a gap and the eye goes to a trend, the chart type is wrong — go back to
  `flint-chart` §0.2, do not patch the styling.

### Storytelling read-back

Read the artifact once as its intended audience, without relying on surrounding
prose to rescue it:

| Check | Question |
| --- | --- |
| **First focal point** | Does the eye land on the evidence carrying the Big Idea? |
| **Reading order** | Do headline, context, marks, labels, and annotation unfold in a coherent sequence? |
| **Context** | Can the reader identify measure, population, time, units, and comparison baseline? |
| **Accessibility** | Does critical meaning survive without color through labels, shape, position, stroke, or texture? |
| **Study cost** | Is the treatment appropriate for the audience's available reading time and fluency? |
| **Visual independence** | Does the visual carry the claim without the explanation doing all the work? |

If the first focal point or reading order is wrong, return to chart selection,
technique, or ThemeSpec. Do not compensate by writing a longer caption.

### Mutation check (decision-bearing values)

Rendering checks confirm the picture drew. They cannot confirm the numbers are
right, so a figure can pass every geometry, catalog, and accessibility check
while asserting something false.

Before shipping a figure whose numbers drive a decision:

1. Change one decision-bearing value in the source data.
2. Regenerate the artifact.
3. Require the output to change visibly, and any coupled check to fail.
4. Restore the source bit-identically and regenerate once more.

If the output does not move, the figure is not reading the data it claims to
read. Visual inspection does not find this, because the wrong number renders
exactly as cleanly as the right one.

Check every surface carrying the value, not only the plotted marks: embedded
data, visible labels, aria description, tooltip, caption, and any
evidence-boundary text.

Composes with the `mutation-testing` skill, which applies the same idea to a
test harness. Adapted from the Executable Example Contract in an earlier
visual-storytelling curriculum, absorbed into this plugin.

## Step 5 — report honestly

State which capability you used, that you looked, and what you checked. If you
could not verify, say that instead. Never describe an unopened render as
verified.

## Playwright MCP setup

> **Muse edition:** rung 2 was the optional `alex-playwright` MCP server in the
> Copilot edition. There is no MCP consumer in Muse — use the host's native
> browser tools instead (see `docs/muse-capability-map.md`). The Copilot-edition
> setup below (reviewed `@playwright/mcp@0.0.80` pin, `setup-dependencies`
> provisioning, per-host `mcp.json` paths, the `--allow-unrestricted-file-access`
> flag and its security note, `.playwright-mcp/` housekeeping) is preserved for
> reference.

## Troubleshooting

| `Browser distribution '<channel>' is not found` | No bundled browser — the selected channel is not installed on this machine                       | Switch `--browser` to a channel that is present (`msedge` / `chrome` / `firefox` / `webkit`), or run `npx playwright install <channel>` |
| Server reports a version like `1.62.0-alpha-…`  | That is the underlying **Playwright library** version, not the `@playwright/mcp` package version | Do not pin against what the handshake reports                                                                                           |
| Tools never appear at all                       | Config in the wrong path or under the wrong top-level key                                        | Same trap as `flint` — see the per-host table in the `flint-chart` skill                                                                |

## Anti-patterns

- **Declaring an artifact done because the tool returned success.** The tool
  reporting OK means bytes were written, not that the picture is true.
- **Trusting a batch edit's summary line.** When a multi-edit call reports
  "1 succeeded, 1 failed", verify _which_ one landed by inspecting the file
  before re-rendering. The visible change is often not the one that succeeded.
- **One full-page screenshot for a multi-figure report.** Defects hide in the
  figures you did not focus.
- **Verifying against sample data only.** The failure mode this skill exists for
  appears when real data meets the spec.
- **Installing the Playwright server on a host that already has a browser
  capability.** Redundant dependency, extra config surface, no gain. Rung 1
  before rung 2, always.
- **Diagnosing an empty chart before re-capturing.** JS-rendered charts draw
  after load; one early screenshot is not evidence of an empty binding.
- **Screenshotting without reading the console.** The console usually names the
  cause — a 404'd image, a failed font, a thrown spec error — while the picture
  only shows the symptom.
- **Reporting a `file://` pass for an artifact that fetches its own content.**
  The agent browser is more permissive than the reader's browser. Serve it over
  `http://` first, or name the origin you actually verified against.
- **Standing up a server before trying `file://`.** `file://` is documented and
  usually sufficient. Escalate on evidence, not on habit.
- **Fixing a data or chart-type problem with a style tweak.** Recoloring a mark
  that is wrong because two scales merged hides the bug instead of fixing it.

## Would Revise If

Revise this skill by 2026-10-25 (90 days) or sooner if:

- **The mutation check never fails on a real figure across ~10 shipped charts.**
  Either the pipeline is genuinely sound, or the check is being run as a
  formality. Confirm by seeding one deliberate defect before cutting the step.

- **The host's built-in browser tools gain or lose console-error access.**
  `browser_console_messages` is currently the main capability that justifies the
  optional Playwright server at all.
- **A host appears whose canvas renders HTML for the _user_ but returns nothing
  to the agent.** Capability 2 in Step 1 assumes "renders" and "agent can read
  it back" usually travel together. A surface that splits them would make rung 3
  the common case rather than the exception, and Step 5's honesty requirement
  the most load-bearing part of this skill.
- **`@playwright/mcp` changes its `file://` default.** The security note and the
  flag table both assume navigation is blocked unless the flag is set.
- **The integrated browser changes its `file://` posture** — either dropping
  support, or tightening `fetch()` to match a normal browser. The _When
  `file://` is not enough_ table assumes agent-permissive and reader-strict; if
  they converge, both the table and the agent-browser-only catalog row collapse
  to one line.
- **Agent-opened tabs gain the user's session.** The auth row says to share a
  tab precisely because agent-opened tabs are ephemeral. If that changes, the
  row is wrong.
- **`@playwright/mcp` ships a bundled browser by default.** The troubleshooting
  row about installed-Chrome-by-channel would then be wrong.
- **A failure mode recurs that is not in either catalog above.** The tables are
  the load-bearing content; extend them rather than adding tooling.
- **The general catalog stays unused across several sessions.** That would mean
  this skill is really chart-only in practice and the broader name overpromises —
  either narrow the name back or delete the general table.
- **Verification is consistently skipped by users**, indicating the step is too
  heavy and should collapse into the `flint-chart` render step instead of
  standing as its own skill.
