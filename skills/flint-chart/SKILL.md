# flint-chart: pick, author, and render a chart

## Load the version-matched Flint language first

Read `flint://agent-skill` or invoke `author_flint_chart` before authoring. That
source-owned resource carries the exact semantic types, chart templates,
properties, and backend boundaries for the installed MCP version. This skill
adds Alex-owned framing, creative treatment selection, configured-runtime
setup, and `render-verify`; it does not replace Flint's language reference.

For the conceptual grammar, compiler model, data-access boundary, backend
contract, rendered-demo evidence, and tagged Microsoft links, read
[`references/flint-language-reference.md`](references/flint-language-reference.md).
It describes the published `0.5.1` contract that Illustrator pins. Use the MCP
resource, `list_chart_types`, and `list_themes` as the final authority for the
runtime actually installed in the host.

## What you produce (and what you do NOT)

Your output is the **spec**: the `chart_spec` and `semantic_types` of a
`ChartAssemblyInput`. You reference data columns **by name**. The host
passes the resulting input to `assembleVegaLite`, `assembleECharts`,
or `assembleChartjs` to get a backend spec.

**You write the input spec, not the output spec.** And critically:

- **DO** emit `chart_spec` (chart type, channel→field mapping, properties)
  and `semantic_types` (field → semantic type).
- **Carry the claim into a standalone chart.** Set `chart_spec.title` to the
  Chart Brief's Big Idea, tightened only for display, and use `subtitle` for
  what is measured, of whom, when, and in which units. A chart may travel
  without its surrounding prose; its claim must travel with it.
- **Reference columns by name.** How `data` itself gets bound depends on
  the situation — a URL, a host-side variable, or embedded rows (see "How
  data gets bound"). Embedding is fine for small tables; just don't
  re-serialize a _large_ dataset by hand, since that risks truncation and
  silent value corruption and wastes tokens.
- **Transform data before Flint.** If the requested chart needs aggregation,
  filtering, joins, pivots, derived columns, or long/wide reshaping beyond
  Flint's built-in static-series fold, use a coding, notebook, SQL, or data tool
  first. Then author the Flint spec against the transformed table.
- **Style after Flint, only when needed.** Author structure in Flint. For a
  presentation tweak Flint does not express (a reference line, annotation, or
  shaded band), use the Vega-Lite escape hatch — see "Post-Flint style
  customization". Never feed edited Vega-Lite JSON back to `render_chart`.
- **Look at what you rendered.** A chart with a collapsed scale, a merged color
  scale, or an empty data binding renders as a valid image that tells the wrong
  story — `validate_chart` cannot catch that. Load the `render-verify` skill
  after rendering, and always after a post-Flint Vega-Lite edit.

## Verify Flint is available before rendering

Before you promise to render a chart, confirm the tools exist. If they don't,
install them (or ask the user to). Failing loudly early is cheaper than
authoring a spec no one can render.

### For MCP rendering via a directly-driven Flint server (Muse edition)

> **Muse edition:** there is no host-level MCP registration — no `mcp.json`,
> no trust prompts. Instead, provision `flint-chart-mcp` with the
> `setup-dependencies` skill and drive the server **directly over stdio**
> with any MCP client (initialize → `tools/call`). The Copilot-edition
> mechanics below (per-host `mcp.json` paths, trust prompts) are preserved
> for reference only.

1. **Check the server is provisioned** (e.g.
   `node_modules/flint-chart-mcp/dist/cli.js` exists under the runtime
   root). If not, run the `setup-dependencies` provisioning.
2. **Author the spec** as this skill describes below (chart choice,
   bindings, validation) — the authoring guidance is host-agnostic.
3. **Validate, then render** through the stdio client; save the image and
   verify it visually before delivering (see `render-verify`).

### For project code integration

Only needed if the user asked you to write code that **imports** `flint-chart`
directly (not to render via MCP).

1. **Check the project's `package.json`** for `flint-chart` in `dependencies`
   or `devDependencies`. If present, skip to step 3.

2. **If missing, use the project's approved dependency workflow.** Preserve its
  lockfile and configured registry; never probe another registry or select a
  newer package version automatically. The Flint library version must match
  the project's approved compatibility decision.

   ```bash
  npm install --save-exact flint-chart@0.5.1
   ```

  Add renderer peer dependencies only through the same project dependency
  policy; do not use this skill to discover or upgrade their versions.

3. **Import in code:**

   ```ts
   import {
     assembleChartjs,
     assembleECharts,
     assembleVegaLite,
   } from "flint-chart";
   const spec = assembleVegaLite(input); // or assembleECharts / assembleChartjs
   ```

### For Python

Not yet published to PyPI (as of 2026-07-24). Use the npm package or MCP
server for released workflows until the Python release lands.

## When the user wants more than a spec

First decide which workflow the user is asking for:

- **Spec authoring only:** return a `ChartAssemblyInput` or its
  `semantic_types` + `chart_spec` pieces. Do not install packages or write
  renderer code unless asked.
- **MCP chart output:** if Flint MCP tools are available, **default to
  `create_chart_view`** only for a Vega-Lite chart when the host supports MCP
  App UIs — it opens an interactive, live-rendered SVG view with a
  customization panel. For ECharts or Chart.js, use `render_chart` for a static
  artifact or `compile_chart` for backend-native JSON. `render_chart` emits SVG
  or PNG for Vega-Lite/ECharts and PNG only for Chart.js. Use `validate_chart`
  to check a spec without rendering and `list_chart_types` when you need the
  supported chart catalog.
- **Project integration, only when the user asks for code:** add Flint to an
  app, notebook, script, or agentic product, install/import the library, and
  call an assembler in code. Keep the same `ChartAssemblyInput` contract, then
  let the host render the backend result.

For MCP clients, the server uses an exact cache-first package:

```bash
node "skills/setup-dependencies/scripts/runtime-launcher.mjs" flint
```

For JavaScript or TypeScript projects, use the approved project dependency
workflow and preserve the lockfile:

```bash
  npm install --save-exact flint-chart@0.5.1
```

Do not add or upgrade renderer dependencies unless the user explicitly requests
project integration and approves the project's dependency changes.

Then compile with the requested backend:

```ts
import {
  assembleChartjs,
  assembleECharts,
  assembleVegaLite,
} from "flint-chart";

const vegaLiteSpec = assembleVegaLite(input);
const echartsOption = assembleECharts(input);
const chartjsConfig = assembleChartjs(input);
```

Python support is planned for a later release. Until the PyPI package is
published, use the npm package or MCP server for released workflows.

```ts
interface ChartAssemblyInput {
  // Bound by the HOST or by you, depending on the situation (see below).
  data: { values: any[] } | { url: string };
  semantic_types?: Record<string, string>; // field → semantic type  ← you write this
  chart_spec: {
    //                        ← you write this
    chartType: string; // e.g. "Scatter Plot"
    title?: string; // claim-bearing headline for a standalone Vega-Lite chart
    subtitle?: string; // measure, population, period, and units
    encodings: Record<string, EncodingValue>; // channel → { field, ... } (or array)
    baseSize?: { width: number; height: number }; // target layout size, default 400×320
    canvasSize?: { width: number; height: number }; // optional hard ceiling on stretch
    chartProperties?: Record<string, any>; // per-chart tuning (optional)
  };
  options?: Record<string, any>; // global layout options (rarely needed)
  field_display_names?: Record<string, string>; // readable axis / legend labels
  theme_spec?: string | { extends?: string; [key: string]: any };
}
```

## Carry the Big Idea into the chart

For a standalone chart, use the Chart Brief as the source of its presentation
text:

- `chart_spec.title` states the finding in a concise sentence. It is not a
  topic label or an axis title.
- `chart_spec.subtitle` supplies the reading context: measure, population,
  period, and units.
- Omit both only when a surrounding caption already supplies the same reading,
  such as a sparkline in a table or a dashboard tile beneath a titled panel.

Flint `0.5.1` realizes the title and subtitle in the Vega-Lite backend. When
ECharts or Chart.js is the delivery target, keep the authored text with the
`ChartAssemblyInput` and make it visible in the surrounding artifact after
inspecting the compiled result. Do not move the claim into `theme_spec`:
themes govern presentation, while title and subtitle state what the reader is
meant to understand.

## Calendar Heatmap in Flint 0.5.1

Use `"Calendar Heatmap"` when the question is about daily intensity, recurrence,
or gaps over a long time span. Bind `x` to a date field and `color` to the daily
measure; Flint sums multiple rows from the same day into one GitHub-style
week-by-week cell.

Calendar Heatmap is available on the `vegalite` and `echarts` backends in the
reviewed `0.5.1` runtime. For an interactive MCP App use Vega-Lite with
`create_chart_view`; use `render_chart` or `compile_chart` for ECharts. It is
not listed for Chart.js, so choose a standard `Heatmap` or another supported
alternative there. Always call `list_chart_types` when the runtime version is
unknown or has changed.

## Choose a visual theme

Call `list_themes` when the audience or tone calls for a coherent house style.
Use a preset ID beside `chart_spec`, for example `theme_spec: "economist"`, or
load `flint-theme` for a custom or inherited ThemeSpec. ThemeSpec controls
presentation and compiler behavior; it does not choose fields, aggregation,
filtering, sorting, titles, or values.

Flint `0.5.1` themes apply to Vega-Lite. ECharts and Chart.js ignore ThemeSpec,
so do not claim cross-backend parity. For a custom system, validate the bare
ThemeSpec in Theme Lab and inspect a representative chart corpus before using it
in a deliverable.

## How data gets bound

Use the binding mode that matches the runtime. Do not mix them.

1. **Direct MCP rendering: embed rows.** When calling `render_chart`,
   `compile_chart`, or `validate_chart`, the tool arguments are JSON. If the
   data is small or already transformed by another tool, pass it as
   `data: { values: [...] }`. Do not pass runtime variable names in
   MCP tool calls — the MCP server cannot see your local variables.
2. **Direct MCP rendering: reference a local file.**
   The `flint-chart-mcp` server can load `data: { url: "..." }` from local
   `.json`, `.csv`, or `.tsv` files. By default any local file the agent can
   name is readable (relative paths resolve against the working directory); a
   hardened deployment may reject local file references entirely via
   `--disable-file-reference` (or `FLINT_MCP_DISABLE_FILE_REFERENCE`), in which
   case pass rows inline with `data.values`. Remote URL
   fetching is disabled. If the data must be transformed first, use a
   coding/data tool to write a small prepared file, then reference that file.
3. **Generated application or notebook code: bind runtime variables.** If the
   user asks you to add Flint to code, write normal data-loading code first and
   pass a real runtime value, e.g. `data: { values: rows }`, to
   `assembleVegaLite`, `assembleECharts`, or `assembleChartjs`. This variable
   pattern is for generated code, not for MCP tool calls.

For spec-only answers, return the `semantic_types` and `chart_spec` pieces and
state how the host should bind data. In the worked examples below, `data` is
shown as `{ values: [] }` to signal "host binds this" — focus on `chart_spec`
and `semantic_types`.

## Data transformation before charting

Flint is a chart compiler, not a data-wrangling layer. If the chart needs grouped
totals, time buckets, filters, joins, pivots, derived ratios, or a long-form
table, transform the data first with a host tool, then bind the prepared table
(see "How data gets bound"). Pick semantic types and channels for the transformed
columns, not for columns that no longer exist.

**Sanity-read the values first — don't chart blind.** Inspect the actual data
with your data tool (distinct values per category column, min/max per measure),
not just the column names, and watch for:

- **Embedded totals.** A category column may mix an aggregate level with its
  parts (e.g. `all` alongside `cage-free`/`caged`, or a `Total` region). Charting
  the total with its parts double-counts and flattens the parts — keep one or the
  other on a stacked/grouped/colored channel, not both.
- **Units.** Check whether a rate is a fraction (0–1) or already a percent
  (0–100) before tagging it `Percentage`; don't scale twice.
- **One real entity.** If your breakdown column has a single distinct value, the
  per-group chart collapses to one mark — the intended breakdown is likely a
  different column.

## Post-Flint style customization

Stay at the Flint level for structure (data, chart type, channels, transforms,
sizing, properties) — Flint specs stay portable and regenerate safely. Drop to
backend JSON only after a valid Flint chart exists, and only for a narrow
presentation change Flint does not expose (exact axis/legend/mark styling,
titles, annotations, reference lines, layout polish). Never use it to change the
data, chart type, field mappings, or transforms — fix those upstream.

For a Vega-Lite-specific style tweak:

1. Author and validate the Flint `ChartAssemblyInput`.
2. Render or inspect the Flint chart first, when possible.
3. Call `compile_chart` with `backend: "vegalite"`.
4. Make the smallest necessary style/presentation edit to the returned
   Vega-Lite spec.
5. Render the edited spec in the host environment with a Vega-Lite renderer.

This edited Vega-Lite spec is no longer a portable Flint spec. Do not send it to
`render_chart`; use `render_chart` only for Flint `ChartAssemblyInput`.

**Verification is mandatory here.** Once you leave the Flint level, the MCP
server's validation no longer protects you — an edited spec can render a
plausible-looking chart that is silently wrong. Load the `render-verify` skill:
open the result, read its console errors, and check it against the failure
catalog before declaring it done.

## Publication config preset (books, reports, exec-facing)

When the render target is a book chapter, a print report, or an exec-facing
document, three settings routinely need to be pinned across every chart in the
artifact so the visuals read as one voice. This is a Vega-Lite `config` block
you can drop into the compiled spec (via Step 3 semantic types →
`compile_chart` → backend edit as described above).

> **Print variant of the brand palette.** The categorical range
> below (blue-800 / amber-700 / green-700 / gray-500 / red-700) is the
> **print-quality variant** of the Alex ACT `chart.categorical` palette. The
> **screen variant** (`#10b981` / `#0ea5e9` / `#f59e0b` / `#8b5cf6` / `#ef4444`)
> lives in your project's `.github/config/brand-palette.json`. Same 5-role
> semantic categorical, deeper contrast for paper.

Pin this once at the top of the artifact's chart set; regenerated charts
inherit it without per-chart overrides.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "background": "transparent",
    "font": "Inter, system-ui, sans-serif",
    "axis": {
      "labelColor": "#6b7280",
      "titleColor": "#1f2937",
      "gridColor": "#e5e7eb",
      "labelFontSize": 12,
      "titleFontSize": 13
    },
    "title": {
      "color": "#1f2937",
      "fontSize": 18,
      "fontWeight": 700,
      "anchor": "middle"
    },
    "range": {
      "category": ["#1e40af", "#b45309", "#15803d", "#6b7280", "#b91c1c"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Semantic discipline in the categorical range** — the palette carries meaning
across the artifact, so use each color only for its assigned role:

- `#1e40af` (blue-800) — correct / principled / primary emphasis
- `#b45309` (amber-700) — Composition family / warning / footer takeaway
- `#15803d` (green-700) — approval / correction
- `#6b7280` (gray-500) — muted / de-emphasised
- `#b91c1c` (red-700) — rejection / critique / target line

**Report typography scale** for the HTML surrounding the chart (not the chart
itself):

## Step 0 — pick the chart (when the user hasn't said which one)

**Skip this step** if the user already named the chart type (e.g. "scatter of
weight vs mpg"). Jump to Step 1 and author the spec. Otherwise, work down this
list before choosing a `chartType`.

### 0.1 One-sentence message — the Big Idea

Before choosing a chart, establish the message it should carry. **Load the
`chart-big-idea` skill and run it now** — look in
`.github/skills/local/chart-big-idea/SKILL.md` first (heir-installed), then
`skills/chart-big-idea/SKILL.md` (baseline).

It does four things this step cannot do inline:

- **Reads the surrounding context first** — the prose next to the insertion
  point, the ticket, the section heading, prior captions — so you do not ask the
  user to re-articulate a claim they already wrote.
- **Questions the intent** — whether the chart should exist at all, and whether
  the stated purpose is the real one. If the intended message and the data
  disagree, that surfaces here rather than after rendering.
- **Elicits the Big Idea** with a three-question ladder, one question at a time,
  when it is not written down anywhere.
- **Asks the TRADITIONAL vs INNOVATIVE style stance**, which changes the
  chartType you pick in §0.2.

The output is a compact Chart Brief. Treat it as the constraint on everything
below: §0.2 selection, §0.4 coverage, and the spec you author in Steps 1-3.

**If that skill is not available**, do the compact version inline
(Knaflic — _Storytelling with Data_):

- What is your unique point of view?
- What is at stake?
- Express it as a complete sentence, not a phrase.

If you cannot write the sentence, ask the user for context before drawing.
"Show sales" is a phrase; "Q4 sales dropped 18% in APAC — that's where our
attention should go this quarter" is a sentence. The sentence shape drives the
chart choice.

### 0.2 Question → family → chart

> **Deeper reference**: the [`chart-vocabulary`](../chart-vocabulary/SKILL.md) skill carries the full 7-goal × ~30-chart catalog, CSAR evaluation loop, override decision table, and 5-visual rule. Reach for it when the 7 rows below aren't enough, when evaluating an AI-suggested chart, or when the artifact will be hand-authored (not rendered via Flint).

### 0.3 Anti-patterns — don't recommend

- **Pie with >5 slices** — humans can't compare angles; use `Bar Chart` or `Stacked Bar Chart` with `stackMode: normalize`
- **Pie without a dominant slice** — if no category is ≥60% or the story isn't "X vs the rest", use a `Bar Chart`
- **Word cloud for real analysis** — position and word length distort; use `Bar Chart` of top-N terms (not in Flint; export to another tool)
- **Dual-axis combo without justification** — dual axes mislead by aligning unrelated scales; consider two separate charts
- **Truncated Y-axis on bars** — exaggerates differences; always start `Bar Chart` at zero (Flint does this by default; don't override)
- **Streamgraph when precise values matter** — the flowing baseline sacrifices readability; use `Area Chart` instead
- **Gauge over Bullet** — `Bullet Chart` packs actual + target + qualitative bands in less space with more precision
- **More than 5 series on a Line Chart** — becomes a spaghetti chart; use `row`/`column` facet (Small Multiples) or highlight one series and gray out the rest

### 0.4 Flint coverage — substitutes when the ideal chart isn't native

Some charts from wider visualization literature aren't in Flint's registry.
Recommend the substitute, not the missing chart:

| Ideal chart                                                             | Flint substitute                                               | How                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waffle Chart (10×10 grid %)                                             | `Bar Chart` or `Stacked Bar Chart` with `stackMode: normalize` | Labeled percentage bar communicates the same "N out of 100"                             |
| Chord Diagram (circular flows)                                          | `Sankey Diagram` (ECharts backend)                             | Linear flow is easier to read anyway                                                    |
| Pareto Chart (bars + cumulative %)                                      | `Bar Chart` + `Line Chart` via multi-encoding                  | Sort bars descending, overlay cumulative-% line                                         |
| Beeswarm Plot (every point)                                             | `Strip Plot` with `stepWidth`, `pointSize`, `opacity`          | Jittered points instead of packed; same "every dot is real" story                       |
| Ridgeline Plot (many densities)                                         | `Violin Plot` with `row` facet                                 | Density curves stacked per group                                                        |
| Small Multiples                                                         | any chart with `row` or `column` encoding                      | Native facet support                                                                    |
| Word Cloud / Sentiment / NPS Gauge / Likert / Mind Map                  | Not in Flint's scope                                           | Export prepared data to Power BI / Tableau / dedicated tool                             |
| Hierarchy visualization                                                  | `"Tree"` (ECharts only)                                       | Use `detail` for node labels, `color` for parent grouping, and `size` for values; validate the installed catalog before authoring |
| Control Chart / Run Chart / Pareto / Process Capability (SPC)           | Not in Flint's scope                                           | Use a dedicated SPC / Six Sigma tool; Flint isn't built for statistical process control |
| Decomposition Tree / Key Influencers / Smart Narrative (AI-Powered)     | Not in Flint's scope                                           | These are Power BI features; Flint is a chart compiler, not an analytics engine         |
| Table / Matrix (precise value lookup)                                   | Use a data table (not Flint)                                   | Stephen Few's rule — tables for lookup, graphs for pattern                              |

This table is a **catalog** boundary: Flint does not offer these chart types.
[`ascii-chart`](../ascii-chart/SKILL.md) carries a separate **medium** boundary
listing forms ASCII cannot carry at all, such as pie, donut, sunburst, violin,
and streamgraph, because angle and smooth curves need resolution a character
cell does not have. The two lists barely overlap and are not interchangeable: a
chart absent here may render fine in ASCII, and a chart Flint renders well may
be impossible in ASCII.

### 0.5 When to fetch a deep reference

Four reference layers, ordered by cost. Fetch the cheapest one that answers the question.

**Chart selection — "which chart for which analytical question?"**

Fetch [The Defensible Decision — Complete Chart Gallery](https://www.thedefensibledecision.com/gallery/chart-gallery.html) when:

- The user asks about a chart not in §0.2 or §0.4
- The user asks "what other charts could work here?"
- The user needs per-chart design tips (axis handling, color, labeling, accessibility)
- The compact table above is ambiguous for the case at hand

The gallery has 48 charts across 10 families with per-chart 💡 tips, distilled from Knaflic / Kirk / Few / Wexler.

**Chart capability and language — runtime (fastest, always matches the pinned server version)**

Two runtime paths that need no fetch and always reflect the actual server the user has installed:

- **`list_chart_types` MCP tool** — call with `{ backend: 'vegalite' | 'echarts' | 'chartjs' }` to get the current server's chart-type catalog and encoding channels. Zero-fetch; matches whatever `flint-chart-mcp` version is pinned.
- **`flint://chart-types` MCP resource** — a browsable version of the same catalog, exposed as an MCP resource for hosts that surface resources in their UI (e.g., Claude Desktop). Same data, host-native display.
- **`flint://agent-skill` MCP resource** — the complete version-matched chart
  language and authoring contract. Prefer it over copied type and property tables.
- **`list_themes` + `flint://theme-skill`** — discover preset IDs and load the
  version-matched ThemeSpec grammar. Illustrator's `flint-theme` skill adds the
  Theme Lab and visual-QA loop.

Prefer these over external references when the question is "does the server I'm actually talking to render `<chartType>` on `<backend>`?" They cost nothing and cannot go stale.

> **0.5.x note.** The underlying library's backend-neutral recommendations,
> named views, and chart transformations surface through the interactive
> Vega-Lite's `create_chart_view` MCP App rather than separate tools. Use it to
> explore compatible arrangements without changing the data or semantic truth
> layer. ECharts and Chart.js workflows use static rendering or compilation;
> headless workflows keep using §0.2 plus `list_chart_types`.

**Chart capability — gallery (canonical live examples)**

Fetch the canonical [Flint gallery](https://microsoft.github.io/flint-chart/#/gallery/vegalite) (maintained by the microsoft/flint-chart team; always tracks the current release) when:

- You need to confirm Flint actually renders a specific `chartType` on a specific backend. Swap the trailing `/vegalite` → `/echarts` or `/chartjs` to view the same catalog for other backends.
- The user is deciding between Vega-Lite vs ECharts vs Chart.js and wants to see the same chart family rendered natively on each backend.
- You need a live example of a chart variant (e.g. a _faceted_ boxplot, a _dodge = local_ grouped bar, a _sparse_ streamgraph) — the gallery shows multiple named variants per `chartType`.
- You want the canonical semantic grouping (Bar & Column / Line & Area / Scatter & Points / Distributions / Circular & Radial / Tables & Multi-Dimensional / Maps) that Flint itself uses to organize its chart registry.

This is the authoritative reference for **what Flint actually does**; §0.2–0.4 above is the compact map, but the gallery is the source of truth for edge cases and backend-specific behavior.

**Chart capability — developer documentation**

Use the official [Flint documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/flint-chart/#/documentation/overview)
for language design, semantics, layout, APIs, and backend architecture. Runtime
resources remain authoritative for the installed server's exact vocabulary.
The library documents Plotly and Excel, but the `0.5.1` MCP tool schema exposes
only Vega-Lite, ECharts, and Chart.js; treat other backends as project-code
integration, not MCP capability.

**Rule of thumb**: Defensible Decision answers "should I use a bar or a boxplot?"; `list_chart_types` and the Flint gallery answer "will Flint's `Bar Chart` on ECharts backend do what I need?"; the deep reference (`docs/reference-*.md`) answers "what exact channels and properties does that combination support?".

### 0.6 Design principles (invoke, don't substitute for reading)

Short-form pointers to the underlying literature. Invoke these when justifying
a choice; read the books themselves for depth.

- **Trustworthy · Accessible · Elegant** (Kirk) — check the chart against all three before shipping
- **Tables for lookup, graphs for pattern** (Few) — if the user wants exact values, a data table beats any chart; use `Bar Table` (Flint) only when you want compact bars with labels
- **Explanatory vs exploratory** (Knaflic) — for stakeholder communication, show the pearl, not the oyster bed; strip clutter aggressively
- **Bullet > Gauge Chart** (Few) — always prefer `Bullet Chart` for KPI-vs-target; reserve `Gauge Chart` for large single-KPI tiles
- **Gestalt** (Knaflic Ch. 3) — group with proximity, distinguish with color/shape, connect with lines, enclose with backgrounds
- **Dashboard = one screen, no scrolling, reduce to essence** (Few — _Information Dashboard Design_) — if it doesn't fit, cut, don't scroll

## Step 1 — pick `chartType`

Use one of the registered names **exactly**. Vega-Lite is the default and
broadest backend; the table below lists each Vega-Lite chart type, the
channels it accepts, and its tuning properties (see "Chart-level
properties"). Required channels are noted.

| chartType                  | Channels                                              | Notes / required                                                                                                                                                              |

**Donut chart — the type name differs per backend.** There is no single donut
type that works everywhere; pick by backend:

| Backend | Use | Hole behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vega-Lite | `"Donut Chart"` (added in 0.4.1) | `innerRadius` defaults to **0** — without it the compiled `arc` mark has no hole and looks like a pie. Always set `chartProperties.innerRadius`. |
| Chart.js | `"Doughnut Chart"` (note the spelling) | `innerRadius` defaults to **55**, so it is a donut out of the box |
| ECharts | `"Pie Chart"` + `chartProperties.innerRadius > 0` | no donut type is registered; the hole compiles to a `radius` range |

`"Pie Chart"` with `innerRadius` remains valid on all three backends, so it is
the safe choice when the backend is not yet decided.

**Choosing a bar chart (most common mix-up).** All three take one discrete
category on `x` (or `y`) plus one measure. They differ in how a **second**
category is shown — and each reads that second category from a **different
channel**:

- `"Bar Chart"` — use for a single series. When multiple rows share an `x`, a
  second category on `color` produces stacked segments. For side-by-side bars,
  use `"Grouped Bar Chart"` with the second category on `group`.
- `"Stacked Bar Chart"` — second category on `color`, drawn as **stacked**
  segments within each bar (totals matter). Tune with `stackMode`
  (`stacked` / `normalize` / `layered`).
- `"Grouped Bar Chart"` — second category on the **`group`** channel, drawn as
  **side-by-side (dodged)** bars within each `x` cluster (compare values
  directly). Put the clustering category on `group`, _not_ `color`.

Rule of thumb: comparing parts-to-whole → Stacked; comparing values
side-by-side → Grouped (use `group`); single series → Bar.

**Waterfall color is a special "Type" column, not a free category.** On a
`"Waterfall Chart"` the `color` channel is reserved for a _type_ field whose
values are literally `start`, `delta`, and `end` — it drives which bars anchor
to zero, not an arbitrary grouping. Do **not** bind `color` to an
`Increase`/`Decrease` (or up/down, gain/loss) category: the up/down direction is
already derived from the **sign** of the `y` value and colored automatically
(green up / red down). For the common case, **omit `color` entirely** and let
Flint infer the start/delta/end and per-bar sign coloring. To force which bars
are anchored totals, use the `totals` property (`first`/`last`/`both`), not a
color field. Only bind `color` when you genuinely have a `start`/`delta`/`end`
type column.

**Backend coverage.** Vega-Lite supports all of the above. Other backends
support a subset (verify if targeting a non-VL backend):

- **ECharts** adds: `"Calendar Heatmap"`, `"Gauge Chart"`,
  `"Funnel Chart"`, `"Treemap"`, `"Sunburst Chart"`, `"Sankey Diagram"`,
  `"Parallel Coordinates"`, `"Network Graph"`, `"Tree"`.
- **Chart.js** supports these 22: Scatter Plot, Connected Scatter Plot, Bubble
  Chart, Strip Plot, Bar Chart, Grouped Bar Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Lollipop
  Chart, Combo
  Chart, Histogram, Waterfall Chart, Gantt Chart, Line Chart, Bump Chart, Slope
  Chart, Area Chart, Range Area Chart, ECDF Plot, Pie Chart, Doughnut Chart,
  Radar Chart, Rose Chart.

You do not need to call the library or inspect its source to author the
input — pick from this table.

## Step 2 — map fields to channels

Each channel maps to an **encoding object** `{ field, ... }` (or a bare
string shorthand, expanded to `{ field: "<string>" }`):

```json
"encodings": {
  "x": { "field": "weight" },
  "y": "mpg",
  "color": { "field": "origin" }
}
```

**Encoding object fields** (all optional except `field`):

| Field       | Values                                           | Purpose                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `field`     | column name                                      | Bind the channel to a data column                   |
| `type`      | `quantitative`, `nominal`, `ordinal`, `temporal` | Override the inferred encoding type (rarely needed) |
| `aggregate` | `count`, `sum`, `average`, `mean`                | Force an aggregation on a measure channel           |
| `sortOrder` | `ascending`, `descending`                        | Sort direction for a discrete/sorted axis           |
| `sortBy`    | channel name (e.g. `"y"`) or field               | Sort a category axis by another channel's measure   |
| `scheme`    | Vega scheme name (e.g. `viridis`, `redblue`)     | Color scheme for the `color` channel                |

You usually don't need `type`, `aggregate`, or `sortOrder` — they're
inferred from the semantic type. Set them only with specific intent.

**Multi-series (wide → long).** To plot several measure columns as series,
pass an **array** on `x` or `y` (only those two channels). The library
folds them into long form and synthesizes a series/legend field:

```json
"encodings": { "x": { "field": "month" }, "y": ["sales", "profit"] }
```

All array fields must be quantitative, and you cannot also bind `color`
when using the array form (the fold owns the color/legend). This is the
**only** built-in reshape — there is no `transforms`/`fold` property. For any
other shape (long↔wide, an aggregate the encodings can't express, a derived
column, a pivot, a join), reshape the data first with a host tool — pandas/polars,
Arquero/`Array.map`/SQL, or a data/MCP tool — and pass the result as
`data.values`. If you have no way to transform, surface the gap to the developer
rather than inventing a transform property that does not exist.

## Step 3 — annotate with semantic types

**This is the most important step.** Semantic types drive all downstream
decisions — formatting, zero baseline, color scheme, scale direction, and
more. Pick the most specific type for each field. Full registered set:

| Family                     | Semantic types                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Temporal (point)           | `DateTime`, `Date`, `Time`, `Timestamp`                                                             |
| Temporal (granule)         | `Year`, `Quarter`, `Month`, `Week`, `Day`, `Hour`, `YearMonth`, `YearQuarter`, `YearWeek`, `Decade` |
| Temporal (span)            | `Duration`                                                                                          |
| Measure (amount)           | `Amount`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `Count`, `Number`                                                    |
| Measure (proportion)       | `Percentage`                                                                                        |
| Measure (signed/diverging) | `Profit`, `PercentageChange`, `Sentiment`, `Correlation`                                            |
| Measure (physical)         | `Temperature`                                                                                       |
| Discrete / rank            | `Rank`, `Score`, `ID`                                                                               |
| Geographic (coord)         | `Latitude`, `Longitude`                                                                             |
| Geographic (place)         | `Country`, `State`, `City`, `Region`, `Address`, `ZipCode`                                          |
| Categorical                | `Category`, `Name`, `Status`, `Boolean`, `Direction`, `Range`                                       |
| Fallback                   | `Unknown`                                                                                           |

What choosing well gets you (automatically):

- `Price` / `Amount` → currency formatting, zero baseline, sequential color
- `Temperature` → diverging color scheme, no forced zero baseline
- `Correlation` → fixed `[-1, 1]` diverging domain
- `Rank` → reversed axis (1 on top), discrete color
- `Date` / `DateTime` → temporal axis with auto-granularity formatting
- `Percentage` → percent formatting, 0–100 domain awareness

If you don't know, use `Quantity` for numbers, `Category` for strings,
`Date`/`DateTime` for date-shaped values. Do **not** invent type names.

## Chart-level properties (`chartProperties`)

`chartProperties` is an optional per-chart tuning map. Set a property only
when the user asks for that behavior — defaults are sensible. These are
**design choices**, not styling overrides (colors/fonts/ticks are still
derived). Values are clamped to the ranges shown.

| Chart type              | Property           | Type / range (default)                                                                                                 | Effect                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bar Chart               | `cornerRadius`     | 0–15 (0)                                                                                                               | Round bar corners (px)                                                                                                         |
| Area / Stacked Bar      | `stackMode`        | `stacked` \| `normalize` \| `center` \| `layered` (unset)                                                              | Stacking behavior; `normalize` = 100%, `center` = streamgraph                                                                  |

**Cross-cutting properties** (apply to position/faceted charts when
relevant; set only to force non-default behavior):

- `independentYAxis` (boolean) — faceted charts: give each panel its own
  y-scale. **Not for Sparkline** — 0.3.0 removed this for Sparkline (rows
  always self-scale now); it still applies to other faceted charts.
- `logScale_x` / `logScale_y` (boolean) — force a logarithmic axis.
- `includeZero_x` / `includeZero_y` (boolean) — force the axis to include 0.
- `xAxisType` / `yAxisType` (`temporal` | `nominal`) — force a temporal
  field to render as discrete bands (or vice-versa).

## Parameter overrides — when to reach for them

Overrides exist, but prefer letting semantic types drive decisions. Reach
for an override only when the user's intent genuinely conflicts with the
default:

- **Force an aggregation:** `encodings.y = { field: "sales", aggregate: "sum" }`.
- **Sort a category axis by its measure:** `encodings.x = { field: "name", sortBy: "y", sortOrder: "descending" }`.
- **Pick a color scheme:** `encodings.color = { field: "region", scheme: "tableau10" }`.
- **Override an inferred type:** `encodings.x = { field: "year", type: "ordinal" }` (e.g. treat a year as discrete bands).
- **Resize the chart:** Flint sizes from two numbers — `baseSize` (the _target_
  it aims for, default 400×320) and `canvasSize` (a _hard ceiling_ it may never
  exceed). With dense data the chart stretches from base toward the ceiling.
  - Want a comfortable size that may grow for dense data → set `chart_spec.baseSize = { width, height }`.
  - Want a fixed slot it must fit inside → set `chart_spec.canvasSize = { width, height }` alone; the chart fills it and shrinks to fit, never overflowing. _What you ask for is what you get._
  - Both → aims for `baseSize`, grows toward `canvasSize`, never beyond.
- **Force log / zero baseline:** the `logScale_*` / `includeZero_*` chart
  properties above.

Global layout tuning lives in the top-level `options` object (e.g.
`addTooltips`, band padding, facet sizing). It is rarely needed for
authoring — omit it unless asked.

## Worked examples

In each example `data` is a placeholder — the host binds real rows or a
URL. You author only `chart_spec` and `semantic_types`.

### Scatter plot

User: "Plot car weight vs fuel economy, colored by origin."

```json
{
  "data": { "values": [] },
  "semantic_types": {
    "weight": "Quantity",
    "mpg": "Quantity",
    "origin": "Country"
  },
  "chart_spec": {
    "chartType": "Scatter Plot",
    "encodings": {
      "x": { "field": "weight" },
      "y": { "field": "mpg" },
      "color": { "field": "origin" }
    },
    "baseSize": { "width": 400, "height": 300 }
  }
}
```

### Revenue bar chart with facets, sorted by value

User: "Show revenue by product line, biggest first, one panel per region."

```json
{
  "data": { "values": [] },
  "semantic_types": {
    "product_line": "Category",
    "revenue": "Amount",
    "region": "Region"
  },
  "chart_spec": {
    "chartType": "Bar Chart",
    "encodings": {
      "x": {
        "field": "product_line",
        "sortBy": "y",
        "sortOrder": "descending"
      },
      "y": { "field": "revenue" },
      "column": { "field": "region" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Time series, multiple series (wide → long via array)

User: "Line chart of monthly sales and profit."

```json
{
  "data": { "values": [] },
  "semantic_types": {
    "month": "YearMonth",
    "sales": "Amount",
    "profit": "Profit"
  },
  "chart_spec": {
    "chartType": "Line Chart",
    "encodings": {
      "x": { "field": "month" },
      "y": ["sales", "profit"]
    },
    "chartProperties": { "interpolate": "monotone", "showPoints": true }
  }
}
```

### Donut chart, value on `size`

User: "Show market share by vendor as a donut."

Pie/donut maps the slice value to `size` (rendered as angle) and the
category to `color`. Data is already long (one row per vendor).

On **Vega-Lite**, use the first-class `"Donut Chart"` type. `innerRadius`
defaults to 0, so set it — without it the chart compiles to a plain `arc` mark
with no hole:

```json
{
  "data": { "values": [] },
  "semantic_types": {
    "vendor": "Category",
    "share": "Percentage"
  },
  "chart_spec": {
    "chartType": "Donut Chart",
    "encodings": {
      "size": { "field": "share" },
      "color": { "field": "vendor" }
    },
    "chartProperties": { "innerRadius": 60 }
  }
}
```

On **ECharts**, no donut type is registered — use `"Pie Chart"` with the same
`innerRadius`. On **Chart.js**, use `"Doughnut Chart"` (that spelling), which
already has a hole by default:

```json
{
  "chart_spec": {
    "chartType": "Doughnut Chart",
    "encodings": {
      "size": { "field": "share" },
      "color": { "field": "vendor" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Bullet chart (KPI vs target)

User: "Show each rep's sales against their quota."

```json
{
  "data": { "values": [] },
  "semantic_types": {
    "rep": "Name",
    "sales": "Amount",
    "quota": "Amount"
  },
  "chart_spec": {
    "chartType": "Bullet Chart",
    "encodings": {
      "y": { "field": "rep" },
      "x": { "field": "sales" },
      "goal": { "field": "quota" }
    }
  }
}
```

## What you should NOT do

- **Don't re-emit the data.** Reference columns by name; let the host bind
  `data` (url, variable, or small literal). Never paste large datasets.
- **Don't write backend specs directly** — write the `ChartAssemblyInput`,
  then call the assembler. That's the whole point.
- **Don't invent transforms.** The only built-in reshape is the array form
  on `x`/`y`. If the data shape is wrong for the chart, say so and ask the
  host to reshape it.
- **Don't invent field names.** Reference only columns that exist, spelled
  exactly. If the data is the wrong shape for the chart, reshape it upstream
  rather than guessing column names that aren't there.
- **Don't set `type`/`aggregate`/`sortOrder`** unless intent conflicts
  with the default.
- **Don't pass colors, font sizes, axis tick counts** — the compiler
  derives these. Users fine-tune the _output_ spec.
- **Don't invent semantic type names.** If none fit, use the family
  default (`Quantity`, `Category`, `Date`).
- **Don't call the library to discover channels/types** — this document is
  the authoring reference.

## Validation checklist

Before returning, verify:

1. `chartType` is an exact registered name supported by the target backend.
2. Every `field` referenced in `encodings` is a real column name.
3. Every encoded field has an entry in `semantic_types` (specific type).
4. Required channels for the chart type are present (e.g. Bullet→`goal`,
   Candlestick→`open/high/low/close`, Pie→`size`+`color`).
5. Any `chartProperties` keys are valid for that chart type and in range.
6. You did **not** inline large data or hand-tune derived styling.
7. The data carries no embedded total/subtotal level (e.g. an `all` / `total`
   row) mixed with its components on a stacked, grouped, or colored channel.
8. Compiler warnings were inspected; a successful render may still have
  truncated categories to fit the layout budget.
9. Any ThemeSpec was checked on a representative corpus and is supported by the
  selected backend.

## Would Revise If

Revise this skill by 2026-10-22 (90 days) or sooner if any of the following fires:

- [_The Defensible Decision_ chart gallery](https://www.thedefensibledecision.com/gallery/chart-gallery.html) 404s or restructures such that the §0.5 deep-reference URLs no longer resolve — refresh the escalation targets or fold the needed tips into §0 directly.
- `flint://agent-skill` or `flint://theme-skill` disappears, diverges from the
  runtime tool schema, or cannot be read on a supported host — restore only the
  minimum local reference needed while the upstream defect is active.
- `flint-chart-mcp` ships a breaking change (chart-type rename, `ChartAssemblyInput` shape change, tool signature change) that this skill doesn't account for — sync §0.4 (Flint coverage) and the worked examples to the new version.
- Any recommendation in §0.2 (question → family → chartType) is refuted by a source we trust (a case study, a Knaflic/Kirk/Few/Wexler update, or field feedback from ≥2 heir workspaces) — retire or rework that row.
- The plugin gets ≥3 heir installs and none of them exercise §0.5 (deep-reference escalation) — that signals the compact table alone is sufficient and §0.5 is decorative; prune it.
- The upstream fork base ([`microsoft/flint-chart/agent-skills/flint-chart-author/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/flint-chart/blob/main/agent-skills/flint-chart-author/SKILL.md)) publishes a materially revised body — decide whether to rebase §1-N onto the new upstream or hold on the current fork point. **Do not rebase blindly.** As of 2026-08-05 upstream's skill is itself behind its own generated references: it still teaches "Donut chart: use `Pie Chart` with `innerRadius`" and never names the `Donut Chart` type that `reference-vegalite.md` documents. A straight rebase would regress the backend-specific donut guidance and the corrected `binCount` / `polyOrder` ranges in §Chart-level properties. Diff against the generated `reference-*.md` files, not against upstream's skill.
- **Upstream absorbs chart selection itself.** Recommendations, named views,
  and transformations are available through `create_chart_view`, but not as
  headless tools. If they become tool-reachable and match or beat §0.2 on the
  same question, call upstream and keep only Alex framing on top.
- **The backend list changes.** §0.4 and the worked examples assume Vega-Lite /
  ECharts / Chart.js because those are the `0.5.1` MCP enum values. If a future
  server accepts Plotly or Excel, rework coverage and ThemeSpec boundaries.
